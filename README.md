# Data-Analysis
Inverse Value
  This python notebook will create a sheet in your google account and take data from that sheet.
  If you have a function y = f(x)
  You know y and the function. Now you are searching for x.
  All you have to so is enter the function and the domain for which y is given and a step-size to set the accuracy of x.
  Then the values of y saved in your sheet will be used and corresponding to each y value you will get a x value printed on the  screen.
